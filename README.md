This is a college project on database system tuning and query optimization.

## Tools
-   __MySQL__ : relational DBMS.
-   __MongoDB__ : NoSQL DBMS.

## Phase One

### Requirements

-   Given a relational database schema, we are required to :
    -   Describe the system and its hardware specifications.
    -   Design an ER diagram.
    -   Implement the schema using both relational and NoSQL DBMS.
    -   Fill database with huge amount of data using any software.
    -   Extract a report of the database statistics.

### Tasks

-   Describe the system and its hardware specifications -> __Mohamed Ahmed__.
-   Design an ER diagram -> __Remonda Talaat__.
-   Implement the schema, fill the database and extract a report in relational DBMS -> __Mohamed Ramzy__.
-   Implement the schema, fill the database and extract a report in NoSQL DBMS -> __Mohamed Shawky__.
-   All members are supposed to learn __MongoDB__ for phase two.

### Questions

-   How are we going to obtain the database schema ?
-   What is exactly required for the hardware specifications ?
